## ML Business Case



## Dashboard Design
A summary page, showing the project dataset summary and the client's requirements.
A page listing your findings related to a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew
A page containing:
A link to download a set of cherry leaf images for live prediction (you may use the Kaggle repository that was provided to you).
A User Interface with a file uploader widget. The user should have the capacity to upload multiple images. For each image, it will display the image and a prediction statement, indicating if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew and the probability associated with this statement.
A table with the image name and prediction results, and a download button to download the table.
A page indicating your project hypothesis and how you validated it across the project.
A technical page displaying your model performance.
